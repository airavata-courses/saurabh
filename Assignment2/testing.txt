Steps to start:
1) Hit the URL: http://149.165.168.193:8080/job/secret_resource/build?TOKEN=secret_service
It will ask for credentials:
User name: admin
Password: password
This asks Jenkins to start the services on 149.165.168.224


2) Go to http://149.165.168.224:3002
This is the server where the services are deployed


3) Run the test cases:
i) Authentic and authorized user -> Secret resource should be fetched in this case

Input:
User ID: 2
Password: password2
Resource ID: 1

Expected output:
{"isAuthorized":true,"responseCode":200,"resource":"resource1:secret1"}


ii) Unauthentic user -> Should show a message saying that the user is not authentic
Input:
User ID: 2
Passord: WrongPassword
Resource ID: 1

Expected output:
Unauthentic user


iii) Unauthorized user -> Should show a message saying that the user is not authorized to access the resource
Input:
User ID: 2
Passord: password2
Resource ID: 2

Expected output:
{"isAuthorized":false,"responseCode":401}
