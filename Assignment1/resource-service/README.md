# Resource service
## Description
This service takes resource id as input. This service stores the resource ids and the secret resource strings in a MySQL database. It queries the database to retrieve the resource string with respect to a resource id. If the resource id is **valid**, it returns the secret resource string. Otherwise, it returns a [400](https://httpstatuses.com/400).
This service is written in Java and uses [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) to expose the REST endpoints.
